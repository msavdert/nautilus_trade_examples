# Lock file for UV package manager
# This file will be generated by UV when dependencies are installed
# For now, we'll use requirements.txt until UV generates this file

# UV will create this file automatically when you run:
# uv lock

# The lock file ensures reproducible builds across all environments
# by pinning exact versions of all dependencies and their sub-dependencies
